# Journal

Journal was a personal project of mine to be able to store day to day journal entries to document my coding adventures or just my day-to-day life.

Unfortunately, it had to be put on hold due to working on a new project with a friend called, Shiny.

It uses the Tiny MCE api/component as a way to have a great text editor.

## Technologies Used
 - React
 - Semantic UI
 - TinyMCE HTML Editor
 
This was one of my first projects after graduating so figuring out how to effectively save HTML content and display it on the page was definitely a challenge!

The main page shows the title of the journal, along with the most recently updated date. From there you're able to edit the title, from an input, and edit the journal if you'd like which then displays the editor.

The left side panel shows all current journals saved. 

The login and registration feature was still in progress before I had to put this project on hold.
